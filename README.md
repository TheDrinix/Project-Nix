# Project Nix ü§ñ‚ú®

Welcome to Project Nix! This monorepo hosts **Nix**, a versatile Discord bot, and its accompanying **web dashboard** for seamless configuration.

## üìú Overview

**Nix** is designed to enhance your Discord server management with three core features:

* üé§ **Dynamic Voice Lobbies:** Automatically creates and manages temporary voice channels, keeping your server organized.
* üßµ **Thread Watcher:** Actively monitors specified threads, preventing them from being automatically archived by Discord.
* üì¢ **Customizable Member Announcements:** Delivers personalized welcome, farewell, and ban messages using fully customizable embeds.

The **web dashboard** provides a user-friendly interface to:

* Easily set up, manage, and remove voice channel lobbies.
* Toggle member announcements on or off.
* Customize the content and appearance of announcement embed messages (exclusive to the dashboard).
